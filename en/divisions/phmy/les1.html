					<h3>Types of differentiation of thallus</h3>
					A wide variety of the external form of algae is associated with several types of morphological differentiation
					of thallus, which are found in various systematic groups. However, it should be remembered that there are
					transitions between the individual types of differentiation of the thallus and it is often impossible to draw
					a clear line between them.

					<h5>Monad (flagellum) type</h5>
					It is characteristic of unicellular and colonial representatives, capable of actively moving with flagella in
					the vegetative state. Also optionally there can be stigma and contractile vacuole. Widely distributed in
					algae, not found only in chloroarachniophyte, red and blue-green algae.

					<h5>Amoeboid (rhizopodial) type</h5>
					Unicellular or colonial organisms in which movement occurs due to pseudopodia. There is no cell wall. It is
					found only in chloroarachniophytic, dinophytic and ochrophytic.

					<h5>Palmeloid (hemimodal) type</h5>
					Unicellular or colonial organisms immobile in the vegetative state. They may have flagella or their derivatives, however, they are not intended for movement. It is found in green, ochrophyte, glaucocystophyte.

					<h5>Coccoid type</h5>
					Unicellular or colonial organisms having a rigid cell wall. As a rule, representatives are motionless, and if they are mobile, then the movement is not associated with flagella (for example, mucus in diatoms).

					<h5>Filament (trichalic) type</h5>
					It occurs in multicellular cells located one above the other in the form of a thread. There are both branching threads and non-branching ones. It is found in cyanide.

					<h5>Multifilament (heterotrichal) type</h5>
					There are 2 systems of threads: horizontal (for attachment) and vertical (for assimilation).

					<h5>False tissue (pseudoparenchymal) type</h5>
					It is formed due to tight weaving of threads. Widespread in red algae.

					<h5>Tissue (parenchymal) type</h5>
					It is formed during cell division in 3 planes. It occurs in brown.

					<h5>Siphon type</h5>
					Multi-core thallus without partitions. Partitions are laid in the separation of reproduction structures, with damage and aging.

					<h5>Siphon type</h5>
					It develops as a siphon, but partitions are sometimes laid.
